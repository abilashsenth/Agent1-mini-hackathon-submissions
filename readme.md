# Agent1 miniaturized - hackathon submission

This is a miniaturized version of the original project, specifically designed for hackathon submissions for agent1.ai.

## Overview

This project focuses on autonomous multimodal agents, which are systems capable of processing and understanding multiple types of data inputs, such as text, images, and audio. The goal is to create agents that can seamlessly integrate and analyze these diverse data types to perform complex tasks autonomously.

## Features

- **Multimodal Data Processing**: Handles text, image, and audio inputs.
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Implements AI algorithms to make decisions without human intervention.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes data in real-time for immediate insights.
